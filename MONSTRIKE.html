<H2 style="text-align:center;">Monster Strike is a mobile Japanese role-playing physics game with elements of puzzle, strategy and cooperative multiplayer. It is developed by XFLAG for iOS and Android platforms. The game was created by former Capcom game designer Yoshiki Okamoto. In Japan, its name is often shortened to MonSt. The game can be summed up as a cross between Nintendo's Pokémon and Capcom's Metal Walker; the former in that it centers around monster collecting and the latter in that battles take place using catapult mechanics. </h2>

The Twelve Saints are false gods who have been implanted with the remains of the soul of the abandoned old god Hiruko, and they use their spiritual power to take revenge on the shogunate that persecuted and oppressed them in the past. Using the spiritual power of the Twelve Saints, Hiruko led an army of humans turned into corpses and threatened the countries ruled by the feudal lords of the shogunate. Concerned about the situation, the shogunate general organizes a group of "God Slayers" to subjugate the Twelve Saints. Yakumo, a girl who was raised as a warrior against the Twelve Saints by the "God Slayers", sets out on a journey with the mission of subjugating the Twelve Saints.</p>

This girl, who is the 16th generation, has a unmatched talent, so even though she is from a branch of her family, she has the power that has been passed down from her ancestors, and the "sacred sword" that emits a burning red flash. She usually tries to remain calm and collected in order to fulfill her duties, but because she comes from a special family background, she is somewhat detached from the world, and can be seen to be a little out of touch. . She has a wealth of knowledge about all kinds of weapons, including swords, and knows everything from their structure to how to use them, but she is just clumsy in areas other than combat.</p>

With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba. On November 6, 10,000 players log into SAO's mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO if they wish to be free. He also states that those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths. A player named Kirito is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a portmanteau of "beta tester" and "cheater". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna.</p>

        <p style="font-size:150%"><b>Sword Art Online - Summer Edition (ソードアート・オンライン - 夏仕様):</b> In 2022, a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online (SAO) was released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba. On November 6, 10,000 players log into SAO's mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO if they wish to be free. He also states that those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths. A player named Kirito is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a portmanteau of "beta tester" and "cheater". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna.</p>

A few months later, Piao returns to the village on the verge of death, urging Xin to travel to another village. There, Xin meets a boy nearly identical to Piao, Ying Zheng the current King of Qin. Xin learns that Piao served as a body double for Ying Zheng and was mortally wounded in a power struggle for the throne. Though initially furious at Ying Zheng for causing Piao's death, Xin decides to seize the opportunity and aids Ying Zheng in ousting his younger half-brother Cheng Jiao and reclaiming the Qin throne. Successful in this endeavor, Xin starts his military life as a Qin soldier and then commander on the battlefields of the warring states of China.

After being called by Holly, Joseph's daughter and Jotaro's mother, Joseph arrives with an associate, Mohammed Avdol. They explain that Jotaro's "evil spirit" is actually a manifestation of his fighting spirit, called a Stand, and reveal that they possess Stands as well. Joseph explains that the sudden appearance of their Stands is caused by the nemesis of his grandfather, Jonathan Joestar: Dio Brando, now referred to simply as Dio. Dio has survived his final battle with Jonathan by decapitating his nemesis's corpse and attaching his own head to it. Now preparing for global conquest, Dio has awoken his own Stand and recruited Stand-using assassins to kill Jonathan's remaining descendants. Soon after, Jotaro uses his Stand, which is later named Star Platinum, to defeat the first of these assassins, a transfer student named Noriaki Kakyoin, before freeing Kakyoin from Dio's control by removing a parasitic flesh bud from him. Holly soon becomes gravely ill due to a Stand manifesting in her, which is slowly killing her due to her reserved personality. With little hesitation, Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, and Kakyoin begin a journey to Egypt to kill Dio and save Holly's life.</p>

The center of the curtain is at the Tokyu Department Store. It only traps non-sorcerers, making it so civilians can enter but not exit. Sorcerers can enter and exit the curtain at will, but it depends on the person when it comes to windows. All the civilians inside the curtain are spread out around its perimeter asking for the same thing: "Bring Satoru Gojo." The advanced barrier technique and targeting Satoru points to the culprits being the same as the invaders of the Goodwill Event. The higher-ups instruct Satoru to work alone in order to suppress this major jujutsu terrorist attack and minimize any potential casualties. They also dispatch four squads of jujutsu sorcerers to safeguard the perimeter outside the curtain in case anything gets past him.</p>

The Fire Force was formed by combining people with these powers from the Holy Sol Temple, The Tokyo Armed Forces, and the Fire Defense Agency, and is composed of eight independent companies. Shinra Kusakabe is a third generation pyrokinetic youth who gained the nickname "Devil's Footprints" for his ability to ignite his feet at will, and was ostracized as a child for the fire that killed his mother and younger brother Sho twelve years ago. He joins Special Fire Force Company 8, which features other pyrokinetics who dedicated themselves to ending the Infernal attacks for good while investigating Companies 1 through 7 for potential corruption in their ranks. Shinra begins to learn that the fire that killed his mother was a cover for his younger brother to be taken by the White Clad, a doomsday cult behind the Infernal attacks with agents within the facets of the Tokyo Empire.
